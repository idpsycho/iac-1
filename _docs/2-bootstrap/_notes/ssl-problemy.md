Based on the information provided, the key issue appears to be that the HTTP-01 challenge for the ACME (Let's Encrypt) certificate issuance is failing. The most informative command that revealed this was:

```
kubectl get events -n app-demosub2 | grep demosub2
```

The critical information from this output was:

```
E0826 11:37:26.275683       1 sync.go:190] cert-manager/challenges "msg"="propagation check failed" "error"="failed to perform self check GET request 'http://demosub2.iis-dev.net/.well-known/acme-challenge/MVLmjlJU8z64tEvg9t4Xin4TgUFYdGuHTjq9lFsrs6Q': Get \"http://demosub2.iis-dev.net/.well-known/acme-challenge/MVLmjlJU8z64tEvg9t4Xin4TgUFYdGuHTjq9lFsrs6Q\": EOF" "dnsName"="demosub2.iis-dev.net" "resource_kind"="Challenge" "resource_name"="demosub2.iis-dev.net-tls-cf646-1558146553-3836687183" "resource_namespace"="app-demosub2" "resource_version"="v1" "type"="HTTP-01"
```

This error message indicates that cert-manager is unable to perform the self-check for the HTTP-01 challenge. The connection is being reset (EOF error), which suggests that the challenge endpoint is not accessible or not responding correctly.

To further confirm this, the curl command you ran also showed a similar issue:

```
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
```

These errors suggest that there might be a networking or ingress configuration issue preventing the HTTP-01 challenge from being completed successfully. The problem could be related to the Ingress configuration, network policies, or firewall rules that are blocking access to the challenge endpoint.
